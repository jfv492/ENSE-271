I’d recommend quickly prototyping in XD first, but don’t get too frustrated when you can’t exactly replicate your XD Design
You may include elements and styling from templates, but obviously cannot simply submit a template! Use it is a starting point to add, modify or adapt, like we did in the lab.
You can experiment with a different Page Builder if you would like, like Elementor or Beaver Builder, but expect a performance hit!
