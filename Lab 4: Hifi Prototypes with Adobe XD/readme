Purpose: In the previous lab we looked at using Adobe XD to make high fidelity wireframes. However, these were only static sites with no interactivity. We will now look at using the Adobe XD Prototyping workflow to add some interactivity to our website mockups, which we can demonstrate using the preview function.

We will work together through:

Setting a home page and previewing
Connecting the hamburger menu to each of the pages
Add an automatic carousel to the first page
Have a unique interaction on each of the strange
A slow fade on the shrines page
A draggable gallery on the divine beasts page
A carousel with buttons on the towers page
Add some lightboxes to the locations page
