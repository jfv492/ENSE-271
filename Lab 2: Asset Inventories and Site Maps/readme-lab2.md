Purpose: In this lab, we are going to look at ways of documenting a high level view of a web application, including mapping out the pages that you need using SiteMaps, and mapping out the content needed and completed using a spreadsheet application. These activities broadly fall under the UX category of Information Architecture, which has roots in Library science (organizing and prioritizing content), and Cognitive Psychology (making it quick to learn, easy to understand and navigate).
